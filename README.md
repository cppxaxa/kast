# Cast - Canonical AST
Canonical AST, the only Abstract Syntax Tree you need, with importers+exporters to all languages (planned)

Currently used by [English script](https://github.com/pannous/english-script), [Angle language](https://github.com/pannous/angle) and as a Ruby to python converter. See ast-export.rb and ast_import.py ! Todo: cleanup, improve, write connectors for jvm/java clr/csharp
